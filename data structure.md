# Data structure

<font color=red>A data structure is a way to store or organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently</font> 

<font color=green>we take about data structure as:</font> 

1. <font color=pink>Mathematical / logical models  /// or Abstract Data Type</font>

2. <font color=pink>Implementation</font> 

ADT: focus on the <font color=red>logic structure</font> & <font color=red>operation solution</font> 

> it doesn't include Implementation

For example: we have a Abstract view about a TV

> we know the TV can display scene and can be turned on/off
> 
> > but we don't care how the TV works by,or which manufacture produce it

So ADT is a general project/idea

when it comes to achieve it, we can use different ways with programing language to make it.
